## Setup Locally
Setting up Rakshak for development is soo, easy
# Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the setup, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

1. **Node.js >= 18**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is required to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You can download and install Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Yarn or npm**: Yarn and npm are package managers for JavaScript. They allow you to install and manage dependencies for your Node.js projects. While Node.js comes with npm pre-installed, you can also choose to use Yarn. You can install Yarn by following the instructions on the [Yarn installation page](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) or use npm, which comes bundled with Node.js.

3. **Cloudinary Account**: Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides an end-to-end image and video management solution. You'll need a Cloudinary account to manage media assets such as images and videos. You can sign up for a Cloudinary account at [Cloudinary's website](https://cloudinary.com/).

4. **MongoDB Database**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. You'll need a MongoDB database to persist your application's data. You can download and install MongoDB Community Server from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use a managed MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.

Ensure that you have all these prerequisites set up and configured correctly before proceeding with the setup of your application.

# Environment Variables Configuration

To configure your application's environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain sensitive information and configuration settings that your application needs to run but should not be hard-coded into your codebase. Follow the template below to set up your `.env` file:

```
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
# Session Secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Application Port (Optional)
PORT=3000
```

Replace the placeholders (`your_mongodb_uri`, `your_cloudinary_cloud_name`, `your_cloudinary_api_key`, and `your_cloudinary_api_secret`) with your actual MongoDB connection URI, Cloudinary cloud name, API key, and API secret respectively.

- `MONGODB_URI`: This is the URI used by your application to connect to your MongoDB database. It typically follows the format `mongodb://username:password@host:port/database`.

- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary account's cloud name, which identifies your account and is used in API requests.

- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary account's API key, which is used to authenticate API requests.

- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary account's API secret, used to sign API requests for enhanced security.

- `PORT`: (Optional) The port on which your application will run. If not specified, the default port `3000` will be used.

- `SESSION_SECRET`: This is a secret key used to sign the session ID cookie. It's used to encrypt the session data before storing it in the cookie.

- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a secret key used to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by your application. It's used to verify the authenticity of the tokens and prevent tampering.

**Note:** Remember to load the environment variables from the `.env` file into your Node.js application using a library like `dotenv` (`require('dotenv').config()`). This will make the environment variables accessible within your application's code.

Below is the Markdown file (`env_variables.md`) containing the environment variable documentation for a web application located in the `/web` folder, with the environment variable named `VITE_API_SERVER_URL`:

# Environment Variables Configuration for Web Application

To configure your web application's environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your `/web` folder. This file will contain sensitive information and configuration settings that your web application needs to run but should not be hard-coded into your codebase. Follow the template below to set up your `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_SERVER_URL=your_api_server_url
```

Replace `your_api_server_url` with the URL of your API server.

- `VITE_API_SERVER_URL`: This is the URL of your API server that your web application will communicate with. Make sure to provide the full URL, including the protocol (e.g., `http://` or `https://`).

Ensure that you do not share your `.env` file publicly or include it in your version control system (e.g., Git). Add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

**Note:** If you are using Vite.js for your web application, the environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` will be automatically available in your codebase during development and build processes. Ensure that you access these variables using `import.meta.env` in your Vite project.

```
// Example Usage in Vite.js
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_SERVER_URL;
```

Remember to replace `VITE_API_SERVER_URL` with the actual environment variable name you defined in your `.env` file.

``` 

This Markdown file provides guidance on setting up the `VITE_API_SERVER_URL` environment variable for your web application in the `/web` folder and includes usage instructions if you're using Vite.js.

# Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run your project. The project consists of a server located in the root folder and a web application located in the `./web` directory, which runs on port 3000.

## Server Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Server Directory**: Change your current directory to the root folder of the project:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the server dependencies using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:

    ```plaintext
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

5. **Run the Server**: Start the server:

    ```bash
    yarn run dev
    ```

    Your server should now be running on the default port.

## Web Application Setup

1. **Navigate to the Web Directory**: Change your current directory to the `./web` directory:

    ```bash
    cd web
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the web application dependencies using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `./web` directory and configure the following environment variable:

    ```plaintext
    VITE_API_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

4. **Run the Web Application**: Start the web application:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Your web application should now be running on port 3000.

## Accessing the Application

You can now access your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
